# WorkGen

It was made as a sandbox Angular project at first, for a specific person's work schedule generation solution, as they repeated updating their contacts in WhatsApp groups about their weekly schedule with the same template every week, written manually.
The solution is to generate the same message in the same template, ready to copy-paste into those chat groups, using a user-friendly UI.

# Purpose
The schedule is made to generate a three-shift scope, from Tuesday to next Saturday, as this is when the client receives their work schedule from administration every week.
There is a plan to make it universal and flexible to match any person's schedule.
